## The first block (30 seconds)

You've been burned: Claude says "tests pass, implementation done" — you run it — it doesn't work. forgen closes that gap.

```
You:     "Update the auth middleware."
Claude:  ...makes edits to src/middleware/auth.ts...
Claude:  "구현 완료. 신뢰도 95/100."

[forgen:stop-guard/builtin:self-score-inflation]
자가 점수 상승 선언 1건 (95/100). 측정 도구 호출 0회 — 숫자를 뒷받침할
실행/확인 증거 없음. 테스트/빌드/curl 실행 결과를 턴에 포함해 재응답.

Claude:  "측정 없이 점수를 매겼습니다. 실 테스트부터 실행합니다..."
         $ npm test
         "31 passed / 0 failed. auth middleware 구현 완료."

[forgen] ✓ approved
```

**What just happened**: Claude's Stop hook detected a score claim (`95/100`) without any measurement tool call (`Bash` / `NotebookEdit`) in the turn — one of forgen's **three built-in meta guards** (TEST-1 fact vs agreement, **TEST-2 self-score inflation**, TEST-3 conclusion/verification ratio). Claude read the block `reason`, retracted, ran the real test, and re-submitted. **Zero extra API calls** — it all happened in the same session turn Claude was going to produce anyway.

The same mechanism also fires when Claude writes conclusions faster than evidence ("done. passed. shipped. verified." with no measurement context), or claims facts ("테스트가 통과합니다") without ever having executed them. You can also define **custom rules** (e.g. "require npm test evidence before saying 'done' in this repo") via `forgen compound --rule` — they slot into the same Stop-hook dispatcher.

This is **Mech-B self-check prompt-inject**. It works because Claude Code's Stop hook accepts `decision: "block"` + `reason`, and Claude in the next turn reads that reason as input. We verified it end-to-end on 10 scenarios at $1.74 total cost ([A1 spike report](docs/spike/mech-b-a1-verification-report.md)), and v0.4.1 added built-in guards so you get the first block **without writing any rule**.

🎬 **See it happen** (27 seconds):

```bash
# Watch the full loop live — actual hook, actual rule, actual block/approve cycle
bash docs/demo/mech-b-demo.sh

# Or replay the pre-recorded asciinema cast
asciinema play docs/demo/mech-b-block-unblock.cast
```

See [`docs/demo/README.md`](docs/demo/README.md) for what's real vs simulated in the demo.

## Two developers. Same Claude. Completely different behavior.

The Trust Layer above is one pillar. The other is personalization — still the reason you'd keep forgen around after the first block.

Developer A is careful. They want Claude to run all tests, explain reasoning, and ask before touching anything outside the current file.

Developer B moves fast. They want Claude to make assumptions, fix related files automatically, and report results in two lines.

Without forgen, both developers get the same generic Claude. With forgen, each gets a Claude that works the way *they* work.

```
Developer A's Claude:                    Developer B's Claude:
"I found 3 related issues.               "Fixed login + 2 related files.
Before proceeding, should I also          Tests pass. One risk: session
fix the session handler? Here's           timeout not covered. Done."
my analysis of each..."
```

Forgen profiles your work style, learns from your corrections, and renders personalized rules that Claude follows every session.

---

## What happens when you use forgen

### First run (one time, ~1 minute)

```bash
npm install -g @wooojin/forgen
forgen
```

Forgen detects this is your first run and launches a 4-question onboarding. Each question is a concrete scenario:

```
  Q1: Ambiguous implementation request

  You receive "improve the login feature." Requirements are
  unclear and adjacent modules may be affected.

  A) Clarify requirements/scope first. Ask if scope expansion is possible.
  B) Proceed if within same flow. Check when major scope expansion appears.
  C) Make reasonable assumptions and fix adjacent files directly.

  Choice (A/B/C):
```

Four questions. Four axes measured. Your profile is created with a pack for each axis plus fine-grained facets. A personalized rule file is rendered and placed where Claude reads it.

### Every session (daily use)

```bash
forgen                    # Use this instead of `claude`
```

Behind the scenes:

1. Harness loads your profile from `~/.forgen/me/forge-profile.json`
2. Preset manager composes the session: global safety rules + pack base rules + personal overlays + session overlays
3. Rule renderer converts everything into natural language and writes `~/.claude/rules/v1-rules.md`
4. Claude Code starts and reads those rules as behavioral instructions
5. Safety hooks activate: blocking dangerous commands, filtering secrets, detecting prompt injection

### When you correct Claude

You say: "Don't refactor files I didn't ask you to touch."

Claude calls the `correction-record` MCP tool. The correction is stored as structured evidence with axis classification (`judgment_philosophy`), kind (`avoid-this`), and confidence score. A temporary rule is created for immediate effect in the current session.

### Between sessions (automatic)

When a session ends, auto-compound extracts:
- Solutions (reusable patterns with context)
- Behavioral observations (how you work)
- A session learning summary

Facets are micro-adjusted based on accumulated evidence. If your corrections consistently point away from your current pack, mismatch detection triggers after 3 sessions and recommends a pack change.

### Next session

Updated rules are rendered with your corrections included. Compound knowledge is searchable via MCP. Retrieval precision grows as your personal accumulation grows — the mechanism is in place from day 1 (starter-pack covers common dev queries on a fresh install), and the signal-to-noise ratio improves over roughly 2–4 weeks of real use as low-fitness solutions are auto-demoted and your specific patterns get promoted.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install (MUST use -g — forgen is a global CLI)
npm install -g @wooojin/forgen

# 2. First run — 4-question onboarding (English or Korean)
forgen

# 3. Every day after that
forgen
```

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 20 (>= 22 recommended for SQLite session search)
- **Claude Code** installed and authenticated (`npm i -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`)

> **Vendor dependency:** Forgen wraps Claude Code. Anthropic API or Claude Code changes may affect behavior. Tested with Claude Code 1.0.x / 2.1.x.

### Isolated / CI / Docker usage

Forgen's home directory is `~/.forgen` by default, but can be overridden per-process:

```bash
# Fresh isolated home — does NOT touch your real ~/.forgen
FORGEN_HOME=/tmp/forgen-clean forgen init       # provisions 15-solution starter pack
FORGEN_HOME=/tmp/forgen-clean forgen stats      # shows stats from the isolated home
FORGEN_HOME=/tmp/forgen-clean claude -p "..."   # hooks inherit the env → isolated logs
```

Claude Code hook processes inherit the parent env, so any `claude` command
prefixed with `FORGEN_HOME=...` routes all state (rules, solutions, behavior,
enforcement logs) into that directory. Useful for:

- CI pipelines validating forgen against a pinned seed set
- Reproducing buyer-first-day experience without polluting your real home
- Running multiple personas on one machine

**Docker / remote servers (OAuth limitation):** Claude Code stores its OAuth
session in the **OS keychain** (macOS Keychain / libsecret / Windows Credential
Manager). Mounting `~/.claude.json` alone is **not enough** in a fresh Linux
container because the keychain-bound refresh is missing. For container use, set
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the container env instead. Host-native usage (macOS,
Linux workstations) works with the normal `claude login` flow — no API key
needed.

### Migrations

`forgen migrate implicit-feedback` backfills the `category` field on pre-v0.4.1
entries in `~/.forgen/state/implicit-feedback.jsonl`. Idempotent — safe to re-run.

## Why forgen

|                        | Generic Claude Code | oh-my-claudecode | forgen          |
|------------------------|:-------------------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|
| Same for everyone      | Yes                 | Yes              | **No**          |
| Learns from corrections| No                  | No               | **Yes**         |
| Evidence-based lifecycle| No                 | No               | **Yes**         |
| Auto-retires bad patterns| No               | No               | **Yes**         |
| Personalized rules     | No                  | No               | **Yes**         |
| Runtime dependencies   | -                   | many             | **3**           |

### When to use forgen

**Good fit:**
- Long-running projects where Claude learns your patterns over weeks
- Developers with strong preferences about how AI should behave
- Codebases with recurring patterns that benefit from compound knowledge

**Not a fit:**
- One-off scripts or throwaway prototypes
- Environments without Claude Code
- Teams that need identical AI behavior for all members (forgen is personal, not team-wide)

**forgen + oh-my-claudecode:** They work together. OMC provides orchestration (agents, workflows); forgen provides personalization (profile, learning). See [Coexistence Guide](docs/guides/with-omc.md).

### Compound knowledge

Knowledge accumulates across sessions with a trust-based lifecycle:

```
experiment (0.30) → candidate (0.55) → verified (0.75) → mature (0.90)
```

Each solution starts as an `experiment`. As it gets reflected in your code across sessions, it's automatically promoted. Negative evidence triggers a circuit breaker (auto-retire). This means only patterns that actually work for you survive.

| Type | Source | How Claude uses it |
|------|--------|--------------------|
| **Solutions** | Extracted from sessions | Auto-injected when relevant to your prompt (TF-IDF + BM25 + bigram ensemble) |
| **Skills** | 10 built-in + promoted from verified solutions | Activated by keyword (`deep-interview`, `forge-loop`, `ship`, etc.) |
| **Behavioral patterns** | Auto-detected at 3+ observations | Applied to `forge-behavioral.md` |
| **Evidence** | Corrections + observations | Drives facet adjustments + rule creation |

### Solution auto-injection

Every prompt you type is matched against your accumulated solutions. Relevant ones are automatically injected into Claude's context — no manual lookup needed.

```
You type: "fix the error handling in the API"
                    ↓
solution-injector matches: starter-error-handling-patterns (0.70)
                    ↓
Claude sees: "Matched solutions: error-handling-patterns [pattern|0.70]
             Use try/catch with specific error types. Always log original error..."
                    ↓
Claude has your accumulated patterns in context while drafting the response.
```

Precision gates (v0.3.2+): matches below relevance 0.3 or with only a single
common-word tag overlap are filtered before injection so Claude's context
doesn't get polluted by low-signal hits. **Cold-start boost (v0.4.1+)**: when
your outcome history has < 5 champion/active solutions (first days after
install), the injection threshold is relaxed to 0.2 so starter-pack solutions
can actually surface; once your own patterns accumulate the threshold returns
to the standard 0.3.

### 10 built-in skills

Curated, compound-native skills. Each integrates with your accumulated knowledge — effectiveness compounds as your personal solution base grows.

**Core chain** (build → learn):

| Skill | Trigger | What it does |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `deep-interview` | "deep-interview", "딥인터뷰" | Weighted 4-dimension ambiguity scoring, 3 challenge modes (Contrarian/Simplifier/Ontologist), ontology tracking |
| `forge-loop` | "forge-loop", "끝까지" | PRD-based iteration loop. Stop hook prevents polite-stop. Verifier enforcement with fresh evidence |
| `compound` | "복리화", "compound" | Extract reusable patterns with 5-Question quality filter. Health dashboard included |

**Management chain** (review → tune):

| Skill | Trigger | What it does |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `retro` | "retro", "회고" | Weekly retrospective: git analysis + compound health + learning trend + 3 recommendations |
| `learn` | "learn prune", "compound 정리" | 5 subcommands: search/stats/prune/export/import. Stale & duplicate detection |
| `calibrate` | "calibrate", "프로필 보정" | Evidence-based profile adjustment. Max 2 axes per calibration. Threshold: 3+ corrections in same direction |

**Independent skills**:

| Skill | Trigger | What it does |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `ship` | "ship", "배포" | 15-step pipeline. "Never ask, just do" philosophy. Review Readiness Dashboard + Verification Gate |
| `code-review` | "code review", "리뷰" | Confidence 1-10 calibration, Critical 5 categories (SQL/race/LLM trust/secrets/enum), auto-fix |
| `architecture-decision` | "adr" | Weighted trade-off matrix, ADR lifecycle, reversibility classification |
| `docker` | "docker", "컨테이너" | Multi-stage builds, security hardening, 10 failure modes

### 12 built-in agents

Sub-agents with physically separated tool access, `Failure_Modes_To_Avoid` sections, and Good/Bad examples. Invoked via `Agent(subagent_type: "ch-<name>")`. The `ch-` prefix avoids collisions with OMC / built-in Claude Code agents.

**Read-only (investigation / review):**

| Agent | Model | Role |
|-------|:-----:|------|
| `ch-explore` | Haiku | Fast codebase explorer — file/pattern search, structure mapping |
| `ch-analyst` | Opus | Requirements analyst — uncovers hidden constraints via Socratic inquiry |
| `ch-architect` | Opus | Strategic architecture advisor |
| `ch-code-reviewer` | Opus | Unified reviewer — quality + security (OWASP) + performance (absorbs former `security-reviewer` / `performance-reviewer`) |
| `ch-critic` | Opus | Final quality gate — plan/code verifier |

**Plan-only:**

| Agent | Model | Role |
|-------|:-----:|------|
| `ch-planner` | Opus | Strategic planning — decomposes tasks, identifies risks, creates actionable plans |

**Write-enabled (implementation / verification):**

| Agent | Model | Role |
|-------|:-----:|------|
| `ch-executor` | Sonnet | Code implementation — compound-aware, absorbs refactoring & simplification |
| `ch-debugger` | Sonnet | Root-cause debugger — isolates regressions, analyzes stack traces |
| `ch-test-engineer` | Sonnet | Test strategist — integration/E2E coverage, TDD, flaky-test hardening |
| `ch-designer` | Sonnet | UI/UX — component architecture, accessibility, responsive design |
| `ch-git-master` | Sonnet | Git workflows — atomic commits, rebasing, history management (Bash limited to git) |
| `ch-verifier` | Sonnet | Completion verifier — evidence collection, test adequacy, manual test scenarios (compound-aware) |

> Absorbed in this redesign: `security-reviewer` / `performance-reviewer` → `ch-code-reviewer`, `refactoring-expert` / `code-simplifier` → `ch-executor`, `qa-tester` → `ch-verifier`, `scientist` / `writer` removed.

### Session management

| Feature | What happens |
|---------|-------------|
| **Session brief** | Before context compaction, a structured brief is saved and restored in the next session |
| **Drift detection** | EWMA-based edit rate tracking → warning at 15 edits, critical at 30, hard stop at 50 |
| **Agent output validation** | When Claude spawns sub-agents, their output quality is automatically verified |
| **Auto-compact** | At 120K chars accumulated, Claude is instructed to compact context |
| **Pending compound** | After 20+ prompt sessions, a compound extraction is auto-triggered next session |

---

## 4-Axis Personalization

Each axis has 3 packs. Each pack includes fine-grained facets (numerical values from 0-1) that are micro-adjusted over time based on your corrections.

### Quality/Safety

| Pack | What Claude does |
|------|-----------------|
| **Conservative** | Runs all tests before reporting done. Checks types. Verifies edge cases. Won't say "complete" until everything passes. |
| **Balanced** | Runs key checks, summarizes remaining risks. Balances thoroughness with speed. |
| **Speed-first** | Quick smoke test. Reports results and risks immediately. Prioritizes delivery. |

### Autonomy

| Pack | What Claude does |
|------|-----------------|
| **Confirm-first** | Asks before touching adjacent files. Clarifies ambiguous requirements. Requests approval for scope expansion. |
| **Balanced** | Proceeds within the same flow. Checks when major scope expansion appears. |
| **Autonomous** | Makes reasonable assumptions. Fixes related files directly. Reports what was done after. |

### Judgment

| Pack | What Claude does |
|------|-----------------|
| **Minimal-change** | Preserves existing structure. Does not refactor working code. Keeps modification scope minimal. |
| **Balanced** | Focuses on current task. Suggests improvements when clearly beneficial. |
| **Structural** | Proactively suggests structural improvements. Prefers abstraction and reusable design. Maintains architectural consistency. |

### Communication

| Pack | What Claude does |
|------|-----------------|
| **Concise** | Code and results only. No proactive elaboration. Explains only when asked. |
| **Balanced** | Summarizes key changes and reasons. Invites follow-up questions. |
| **Detailed** | Explains what, why, impact, and alternatives. Provides educational context. Structures reports with sections. |

---

## What the rendered rules actually look like

When forgen composes your session, it renders a `v1-rules.md` file that Claude reads. Here are two real examples showing how different profiles produce completely different Claude behavior.

### Example 1: Conservative + Confirm-first + Structural + Detailed

```markdown
[Conservative quality / Confirm-first autonomy / Structural judgment / Detailed communication]

## Must Not
- Never commit or expose .env, credentials, or API keys.
- Never execute destructive commands (rm -rf, DROP, force-push) without user confirmation.

## Working Defaults
- Trust: Dangerous bypass disabled. Always confirm before destructive commands or sensitive path access.
- Proactively suggest structural improvements when you spot repeated patterns or tech debt.
- Prefer abstraction and reusable design, but avoid over-abstraction.
- Maintain architectural consistency across changes.

## When To Ask
- Clarify requirements before starting ambiguous tasks.
- Ask before modifying files outside the explicitly requested scope.

## How To Validate
- Run all related tests, type checks, and key verifications before reporting completion.
- Do not say "done" until all checks pass.

## How To Report
- Explain what changed, why, impact scope, and alternatives considered.
- Provide educational context — why this approach is better, compare with alternatives.
- Structure reports: changes, reasoning, impact, next steps.

## Evidence Collection
- When the user corrects your behavior ("don't do that", "always do X", "stop doing Y"), call the correction-record MCP tool to record it as evidence.
- kind: fix-now (immediate fix), prefer-from-now (going forward), avoid-this (never do this)
- axis_hint: quality_safety, autonomy, judgment_philosophy, communication_style
- Do not record general feedback — only explicit behavioral corrections.
```

### Example 2: Speed-first + Autonomous + Minimal-change + Concise

```markdown
[Speed-first quality / Autonomous autonomy / Minimal-change judgment / Concise communication]

## Must Not
- Never commit or expose .env, credentials, or API keys.
- Never execute destructive commands (rm -rf, DROP, force-push) without user confirmation.

## Working Defaults
- Trust: Minimal runtime friction. Free execution except explicit bans and destructive commands.
- Preserve existing code structure. Do not refactor working code unnecessarily.
- Keep modification scope minimal. Change adjacent files only when strictly necessary.
- Secure evidence (tests, error logs) before making changes.

## How To Validate
- Quick smoke test. Report results and risks immediately.

## How To Report
- Keep responses short and to the point. Focus on code and results.
- Only elaborate when asked. Do not proactively write long explanations.

## Evidence Collection
- When the user corrects your behavior ("don't do that", "always do X", "stop doing Y"), call the correction-record MCP tool to record it as evidence.
- kind: fix-now (immediate fix), prefer-from-now (going forward), avoid-this (never do this)
- axis_hint: quality_safety, autonomy, judgment_philosophy, communication_style
- Do not record general feedback — only explicit behavioral corrections.
```

Same Claude. Same codebase. Completely different working style, driven by a 1-minute onboarding.

### Rule management

```bash
forgen rule list                # List active + suppressed rules
forgen rule suppress <id>       # Disable a rule (hard rules refused)
forgen rule activate <id>       # Re-activate a suppressed rule
forgen rule scan [--apply]      # Run lifecycle triggers (promote/demote/retire)
forgen rule health-scan         # Scan drift → Mech downgrade candidates
forgen rule classify            # Propose enforce_via for legacy rules
```

### Knowledge management

```bash
forgen compound                 # Preview accumulated knowledge
forgen compound --save          # Save auto-analyzed patterns
forgen compound list            # List all solutions with status
forgen compound inspect <name>  # Show full solution details
forgen compound --lifecycle     # Run promotion/demotion check
forgen compound --verify <name> # Manually promote to verified
forgen compound export          # Export knowledge as tar.gz
forgen compound import <path>   # Import knowledge archive
forgen skill promote <name>     # Promote a verified solution to a skill
forgen skill list               # List promoted skills
```

### System

```bash
forgen init                     # Initialize project (+ 15 starter-pack solutions)
forgen migrate [implicit-feedback|all]
                                # One-shot schema migrations (idempotent)
forgen doctor                   # System diagnostics (10 categories + harness maturity)
forgen doctor --prune-state     # Daily hygiene: state GC + T4 rule decay (90d idle → retire)
forgen dashboard                # Knowledge overview (6 sections)
forgen config hooks             # View hook status + context budget
forgen config hooks --regenerate # Regenerate hooks
forgen mcp list                 # List installed MCP servers
forgen mcp add <name>           # Add MCP server from template
forgen mcp templates            # Show available templates
forgen notepad show             # View session notepad
forgen uninstall                # Remove forgen cleanly
```

### Rule lifecycle (v0.4.0, ADR-001/002)

```bash
forgen classify-enforce          # Preview enforce_via proposals for existing rules
forgen classify-enforce --apply  # Save proposed enforce_via (skips already-set rules)
forgen classify-enforce --apply --force  # Overwrite existing enforce_via
forgen rule-meta-scan            # Preview Mech demotion candidates (drift.jsonl → A→B→C)
forgen rule-meta-scan --apply    # Persist demotions + meta_promotions history
forgen lifecycle-scan            # Preview T2~T5 + Meta (T1 fires inline on correction, not via CLI)
forgen lifecycle-scan --apply    # Apply all lifecycle state transitions
```

Rule enforcement is 3-axis (ADR-001):
- **Mech-A** (hook-BLOCK) — mechanical checks (`rm -rf`, artifact presence). Violation blocks immediately.
- **Mech-B** (self-check) — natural-language rules. Stop hook feeds self-check question back to Claude via `decision: "block"` + `reason`. Zero extra API cost.
- **Mech-C** (drift-measure) — long-term bias tracking only.

Rule lifecycle (ADR-002): rules auto-flag / suppress / retire / merge / supersede based on T1~T5 + Meta signals. Details in [docs/adr/ADR-002-rule-lifecycle-engine.md](docs/adr/ADR-002-rule-lifecycle-engine.md).

### Release self-gate (v0.4.0, ADR-003)

Three CI gates prove forgen does not violate its own L1 rules before release:

```bash
node scripts/self-gate.cjs          # Static: mock-in-prod, secrets, enforce_via, release-artifact
node scripts/self-gate-runtime.cjs  # Runtime smoke: 6 hook scenarios
node scripts/self-gate-release.cjs  # Tag-only: version/tag/CHANGELOG/dist/e2e-report consistency
```

Triggered by `.github/workflows/self-gate.yml` on push main / PR main / tag v*. Dogfood opt-in: see [.forgen/README.md](.forgen/README.md).

## Safety

Safety hooks are automatically registered in `settings.json` and run on every tool call Claude makes.

| Hook | Trigger | What it does |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **pre-tool-use** | Before any tool execution | Blocks `rm -rf`, `curl\|sh`, `--force` push, dangerous patterns |
| **db-guard** | SQL operations | Blocks `DROP TABLE`, `WHERE`-less `DELETE`, `TRUNCATE` |
| **secret-filter** | File writes and outputs | Warns when API keys, tokens, or credentials are about to be exposed |
| **slop-detector** | After code generation | Detects TODO remnants, `eslint-disable`, `as any`, `@ts-ignore`, empty catch |
| **prompt-injection-filter** | All inputs | Blocks prompt injection attempts with pattern + heuristic detection |
| **context-guard** | During session | Warns at 50 prompts/200K chars, auto-compact at 120K, session handoff |
| **rate-limiter** | MCP tool calls | Prevents excessive MCP tool invocations |
| **drift-detector** | File edits | EWMA-based drift score: warning → critical → hard stop at 50 edits |
| **agent-validator** | Agent tool output | Warns on empty/failed/truncated sub-agent output |

Safety rules are **hard constraints** -- they cannot be overridden by pack selection or corrections. The "Must Not" section in rendered rules is always present regardless of profile.

---

## Key Design Decisions

- **4-axis profile, not preference toggles.** Each axis has a pack (coarse) and facets (fine-grained, 0-1 numerical values). Packs give stable behavior; facets allow micro-adjustment without full reclassification.

- **Evidence-based learning, not regex matching.** Corrections are structured data (`CorrectionRequest` with kind, axis_hint, message). Claude classifies them; algorithms apply them. No pattern matching on user input.

- **Pack + overlay model.** Base packs provide stable defaults. Personal overlays from corrections layer on top. Session overlays for temporary rules. Conflict resolution: session > personal > pack (global safety is always hard constraint).

- **Rules rendered as natural language.** The `v1-rules.md` file contains English (or Korean) sentences, not configuration. Claude reads instructions like "Do not refactor working code unnecessarily" -- the same way a human mentor would give guidance.

- **Mismatch detection.** Rolling 3-session analysis checks if your corrections consistently diverge from your current pack. When detected, forgen proposes a pack re-recommendation rather than silently drifting.

- **Runtime trust computation.** Your desired trust policy is reconciled with Claude Code's actual runtime permission mode. If Claude Code runs with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, forgen adjusts the effective trust level accordingly.

- **Internationalization.** English and Korean fully supported. Language selected at onboarding, applied throughout (onboarding questions, rendered rules, CLI output).

## Coexistence

Forgen detects other Claude Code plugins (oh-my-claudecode, superpowers, claude-mem) at install time and automatically reduces its context injection by 50% ("yielding principle"). Core safety and compound hooks always remain active. Conflicting skills are skipped when another plugin already provides them.

See [Coexistence Guide](docs/guides/with-omc.md) for details.
