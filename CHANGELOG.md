## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-22

### v0.4.0 — Trust Restoration

"됐다는데 안됨" 자기모순을 구조적으로 차단하는 3축 강제 메커니즘 + rule lifecycle + release self-gate. 인터뷰 라운드 9~10 미션 "forgen이 자기 규칙을 forgen 자신에게 강제 적용" 달성.

**ADR-001 — Mech-A/B/C 3축 강제 메커니즘** (Accepted)
- Mech-A (hook-BLOCK): 기계 판정 가능 규칙 — PreToolUse deny / Stop artifact_check.
- Mech-B (self-check prompt-inject): 자연어 판정 규칙 — Stop hook `decision:"block"` + `reason` 으로 Claude 자가점검 강제. **β1 ($0): 외부 LLM 호출 없음.**
- Mech-C (drift-measure): 정량 판정 불가 규칙 — 장기 편향만 측정.
- A1 검증 스파이크 10/10 PASS ($1.74, 3분): block 수용률 1.00, FP 0.00, hook p95 7ms, 추가 API 0.

**신규 타입** (`src/store/types.ts`):
- `EnforcementMech`, `HookPoint`, `VerifierSpec`, `EnforceSpec` — `Rule.enforce_via` 에 붙음 (optional, 기존 rule 하위 호환).
- `EnforceSpec.trigger_keywords_regex` / `trigger_exclude_regex` / `system_tag` — Stop hook 전용 발화 조건.
- `LifecyclePhase`, `LifecycleState`, `MetaPromotion` — `Rule.lifecycle` 에 붙음.

**신규 Hook**:
- `src/hooks/stop-guard.ts` — Stop hook. Production `rulesFromStore(loadActiveRules())` 로드, spike scenarios.json fallback. `last_assistant_message` 직접 read. stuck-loop guard (threshold 3 초과 시 force approve + drift 이벤트). `compoundCritical: true` (보호 hook).
- `src/hooks/shared/hook-response.ts::blockStop(reason, systemMessage?)` helper.

**ADR-002 — Rule Lifecycle Engine** (Accepted)
- T1 explicit_correction: `evidence-store.appendEvidence` → `detectT1` → rule retire/supersede/flag. axis + render_key 이중 매칭으로 FP 차단.
- T2 repeated_violation: 30d rolling window `violations_30d ≥ 3 AND rate > 0.3` → flag. 데이터 소스: `~/.forgen/state/enforcement/violations.jsonl` (stop-guard block 시 자동 append).
- T3 user_bypass: `post-tool-use` 에서 `bypass-detector.scanForBypass` → `recordBypass`. 7d `bypass_count ≥ 5` → suppress.
- T4 time_decay: `state-gc.runDailyT4Decay` — `forgen doctor --prune-state` 에서 매일 실행, 90d 미주입 rule retire.
- T5 conflict_detected: `rule-store.appendRule` 에서 T5 감지, 양쪽 `conflict_refs` 기록.
- Meta 양방향: drift.jsonl 누적 → 강등 (A→B→C); rolling 20 injects + 0 violations → 승급 (B→A, C→B).
- Orchestrator `applyEvent` / `foldEvents` pure — rule 파일 쓰기는 호출자 책임.
- `src/store/rule-store.ts::markRulesInjected` — `v1-bootstrap` 이 renderRules 후 호출해 Meta 롤링 카운터를 채움.

**ADR-003 — Release Self-Gate** (Accepted)
- `.github/workflows/self-gate.yml` — push main / PR main / tag v* 에서 3-stage 검증.
- `scripts/self-gate.cjs` — 정적 스캔: mock-in-production, secrets-leak (AWS 공식 EXAMPLE fixture allow list), enforce_via-missing, release-artifact.
- `scripts/self-gate-runtime.cjs` — 6 hook 시나리오 smoke (완료 선언 block / retraction approve / shipped block / mock-context approve 등). 격리 HOME.
- `scripts/self-gate-release.cjs` — tag-only: version/tag match, CHANGELOG section, dist freshness, .forgen-release/e2e-report.json.

**신규 CLI**:
- `forgen classify-enforce [--apply] [--force]` — 기존 rule 을 휴리스틱으로 자동 분류해 `enforce_via` 채움 (Mech-A destructive / Mech-A completion / Mech-B style / Mech-C drift fallback).
- `forgen rule-meta-scan [--apply] [--window N] [--threshold N]` — drift.jsonl 읽어 Mech 강등 후보 산출.
- `forgen lifecycle-scan [--apply]` — T2~T5 + Meta 양방향 전체 실행.

**운영 지표**:
- 전체 회귀 1888/1888 pass (157 files), TypeScript clean.
- forgen doctor 20/20 hooks active.
- Self-gate 3단 체인 그린.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-04-21

### Security — Audit findings landed

Independent read-only audit (docs/claude-audit-brief.md) surfaced 10 structural
issues plus 2 follow-up findings. All 12 are fixed with invariant tests.

**P0 — data loss / code injection**
- **Settings parse-failure data loss** (#2, #10): `settings-injector.ts` and
  `scripts/postinstall.js` no longer silently replace a malformed settings.json
  with `{}`. New `readSettingsSafely()` preserves the corrupt original to
  `settings.json.corrupt-<ts>` and throws; writers release the lock and abort.
  postinstall settings + `~/.claude.json` now use tmp-file + rename atomic write.
- **Code injection via node -e** (#5): `session-recovery.ts` no longer
  interpolates a user-supplied sessionId into a `-e` template literal. A
  dedicated runner at `dist/hooks/internal/run-lifecycle-check.js` reads the id
  from argv — no shell, no eval surface.
- **solution-outcomes race** (#9): all pending-state mutations are now serialised
  under `withFileLockSync` + `atomicWriteJSON`. Concurrent inject / correction /
  error hooks on the same session no longer lose or duplicate events.
- **Archive path traversal** (follow-up #A): `compound-export.importKnowledge`
  rejects entries whose resolved destination sits outside ME_DIR, including
  sibling-directory prefix collisions (e.g. `../me-evil/…`).

**P1 — lock semantics, trust, uninstall, injection precision**
- **Settings-lock live-holder handling** (#1): acquireLock now throws
  `SettingsLockError` on live-PID timeout instead of overwriting the lock;
  releaseLock verifies ownership before deleting.
- **Trust silent escalation** (#3): `preset-manager.computeEffectiveTrust`
  returns a `Trust 상승` warning when runtime is more permissive than desired;
  harness surfaces it to the user; fgx cautions `가드레일 우선`/`승인 완화`
  profile users.
- **Install/uninstall symmetry** (#7): `uninstall` now strips `FORGEN_*` env
  keys (previously only `COMPOUND_*`) and recognises `forgen me` (previously
  only `forgen status`) as the forgen-owned statusLine.
- **Legacy profile guard** (#6): `loadProfile` runs `isV1Profile` and returns
  null on legacy shapes so bootstrap re-runs cutover instead of typing stale
  JSON as v1.
- **secret-filter vendor tokens** (follow-up #B): GitHub PATs (ghp_/gho_/
  ghs_/ghu_/ghr_), Google API keys (AIza…), and Slack tokens (xox[abpors]-…)
  are now detected.

**P2 — label truth, transcript attribution**
- **permission-handler labels** (#4): `approve()`/`approveWithWarning()` never
  set `permissionDecision: 'allow'`; they are pass-through. Log and API labels
  renamed to `safe-pass-through` / `autopilot-warn-pass-through` /
  `autopilot-pass-through` / `pass-through` so audit trails match reality.
- **Transcript per-session attribution** (#8): `spawn.ts` snapshots existing
  transcripts before launching claude and diffs after exit; concurrent sessions
  in the same cwd no longer cross-attribute. Transcript reading switched to
  streaming (`createReadStream` + `readline`).

### Added — Data hygiene

Field audit on a ~2-week-old install found 10,802 files in `~/.forgen/state/`
across 12 filename prefixes, 4.3 MB `match-eval-log.jsonl`, and 80% of
error-attribution events concentrated on 3 solutions injected at relevance
0.15–0.21.

- `forgen doctor --prune-state` (new `src/core/state-gc.ts`): removes session-
  scoped files older than 7 days (checkpoint-, injection-cache-, modified-
  files-, outcome-pending-, permissions-, skill-trigger-, tool-state-,
  reminder-, context-, last-). Aggregate jsonl logs are preserved.
- `solution-outcomes.attributeError` gates: match_score ≥ 0.3,
  injection-lag ≤ 5 min, top-3 by relevance. Prevents blanket blaming of
  every injected solution when a tool fails.
- `solution-injector.MIN_INJECT_RELEVANCE = 0.3` + multi-tag precision gate
  (`matchedIdentifiers ≥ 1 OR matchedTags ≥ 2`): the matcher remains
  permissive for recall@5; only the injection step enforces the stricter
  gate. Zero single-tag high-score injections observed in the field corpus
  after landing.
- `match-eval-log.jsonl` size-based rotation at 10 MB (one generation
  retained).

### Fixed — e2e test isolation

Docker-spawned hooks in `tests/e2e/*.test.ts` were writing session state
(`e2e-tool-chain`, `chain5-test`, etc.) into the developer's real
`~/.forgen/state/`. Each e2e file now allocates a fresh `mkdtempSync` HOME
and injects it into the spawn env; `afterAll` cleans up. Likewise
`tests/hook-response-tracking.test.ts` now mocks `node:os` so the tracking
log never lands outside `/tmp/`.

### Fixed — Stale Docker verify checks

`tests/e2e/docker/verify.sh` was asserting three skills that were deleted in
commit f534227 (v0.3 quality refactor). Result goes from 62/4/6 to 63/0/6
without touching runtime code.

### Notes

- All fixes confirmed via invariant tests (1732/1732 pass across 143 files),
  7 real-world attack scenarios (injection, concurrent mutation, corrupt
  settings, path traversal, prune, doctor smoke), and Linux-clean-environment
  Docker verification.
- Upgrade path from 0.3.1 verified (profile + solutions + non-forgen settings
  byte-identical after upgrade).
- Windows code paths exist but runtime validation is deferred to GH Actions
  Windows runner — see P-D note in release audit.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-16

### Added — Self-Evolving Harness (inspired by Stanford meta-harness)

Three-phase evolution loop around the existing compound solution store:

**Phase 1 — Fitness Loop (Select axis):**
- `solution-outcomes`: per-session inject→outcome event log (accept/correct/error/unknown) with fail-open semantics; attribution through solution-injector (appendPending/flushAccept), correction-record MCP (attributeCorrection), and post-tool-failure hook (attributeError).
- `solution-fitness`: Laplace-smoothed acceptance ratio × log(1+injected) confidence. State classification: draft / active / champion / underperform. No auto-delete — population-relative thresholds only.
- `solution-quarantine`: malformed frontmatter no longer silently dropped — invalid files surface in `~/.forgen/state/solution-quarantine.jsonl` with actionable diagnostics; `listQuarantined` / `pruneQuarantine` helpers.
- `solution-fixup`: schema migration for legacy defects (missing `extractedBy`, missing `evidence` block, missing `supersedes`). Applied to the live install, this recovered 5 dead solutions and one was injected on the next matching prompt.

**Phase 4 — Self-Evolution (Propose + Select axes):**
- `solution-weakness`: structured discovery report from four detectors — under-served tags (correction evidence without a matching champion), conflict clusters, dead corners (injected=0 with unique tags), volatile solutions (accept-rate shift >0.3).
- `ch-solution-evolver` agent: Opus proposer, Bash-disabled, emits exactly 3 novel candidates into `~/.forgen/lab/candidates/` with 30%-80% tag overlap gate and self-critique novelty check.
- Candidate cold-start bonus: solutions with `status: candidate` get confidence × 1.3 so they reach enough injections to accumulate fitness. Auto-promotes to `verified` at 5 injections; bonus disappears naturally.
- Candidate lifecycle: `promoteCandidate` validates schema + refuses name collisions before moving files from lab to `me/solutions`. `rollbackSince` archives every `source: evolved` solution newer than a cutoff to `~/.forgen/lab/archived/rollback-{ts}/` (never deletes — always recoverable).

**CLI surface:**
- `forgen learn fix-up [--apply]` — dry-run repair of malformed solutions.
- `forgen learn quarantine [--prune]` — show / clean dropped solutions.
- `forgen learn fitness [--json]` — per-solution fitness table.
- `forgen learn evolve [--save]` — weakness report + proposer hint.
- `forgen learn evolve --promote --list` / `--promote <name>` — candidate promotion.
- `forgen learn evolve --rollback <epoch-ms-or-ISO>` — time-bounded rollback.
- Dashboard gains a 🎯 Solution Fitness panel (state distribution + top-3).

**Dogfood evidence:** the full pipeline was exercised end-to-end — weakness report → evolver-agent proposal → schema validation → promotion → cold-start-boosted match (relevance 0.78) → injection counter increment.

### Documentation
- `docs/design-solution-evolution.md` — Phase 4 design spec with open questions, prerequisites, and rollout plan.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-15

### BREAKING

- **Skill consolidation: 21 → 10**. Removed: refactor, tdd, testing-strategy, documentation, git-master, ecomode, specify, performance, incident-response, database, frontend, ci-cd, api-design, debug-detective, migrate, security-review. Most were generic checklists; their content is better handled by Claude natively or absorbed into remaining skills.
- **Agent consolidation: 19 → 12**. Removed: performance-reviewer, security-reviewer (merged into code-reviewer as review perspectives), refactoring-expert, code-simplifier (merged into executor), scientist, qa-tester (merged into verifier), writer.
- **Custom frontmatter removed**: Agents no longer use `tier` and `lane` fields (Claude Code ignored them anyway).

### Added

- **5 new skills** designed from best-in-class research (OMC ralph, gstack /ship, /retro, /learn):
  - `forge-loop`: PRD-based iteration with Stop hook persistence. Prevents polite-stop anti-pattern.
  - `ship`: 15-step automated release pipeline with "never ask, just do" philosophy + Review Readiness Dashboard + Verification Gate.
  - `retro`: Weekly retrospective with git analysis + compound health + learning trend + compare mode.
  - `learn`: Compound knowledge management — 5 subcommands (search/stats/prune/export/import) with stale & duplicate detection.
  - `calibrate`: Evidence-based profile adjustment — quantitative protocol, 3-correction threshold, max 2 axes per calibration.
- **Stop hook forge-loop integration** (`context-guard.ts`): When `.forgen/state/forge-loop.json` has incomplete stories, Stop is blocked with persistence message. Circuit breakers: 2h stale threshold, 30 max blocks.
- **Learning Dashboard** (`forgen dashboard`): New "Learning Curve" section showing correction trend (7d vs prev 7d), top correction axes, activity days, estimated time saved via compound injections.
- **Session Summary with Counterfactual**: Session end message now includes "주입된 compound: N건 / 추정 절약 시간: Xh Ym (forgen 없었으면 시행착오 필요)".
- **Plugin system**: `.forgen/skills/*.md` scan path added. Project-level custom skills supported.
- **Stale agent cleanup**: `harness.ts` `installAgents` now removes `ch-*.md` files that don't exist in current source (with marker + hash verification for user-modification safety).

### Changed

- **All 10 skills upgraded** with `<Compound_Integration>`, `<Failure_Modes>`, `argument-hint`. Density dramatically improved despite fewer skills.
- **All 12 agents upgraded** with `<Failure_Modes_To_Avoid>`, `<Examples>` (Good/Bad), `<Success_Criteria>`, and official frontmatter (`maxTurns`, `color`, `permissionMode`).
- **deep-interview rewritten** using OMC research: weighted 4-dimension scoring, 3 challenge modes (Contrarian/Simplifier/Ontologist), ontology stability tracking, anti-sycophancy rules, one-question-at-a-time protocol.
- **Cancel flow**: `cancelforgen` now also deletes `forge-loop.json` to release Stop hook block.
- **Install is global-only**: `package.json` sets `preferGlobal: true` so non-global installs surface a warning (forgen is a CLI on PATH; local installs were unreachable).
- **README**: Added "12 built-in agents" section grouped by tool access (read-only / plan-only / write-enabled) with the absorbed-agent mapping from the 19→12 consolidation.

### Fixed

- **Agent parser compat**: Moved `<!-- forgen-managed -->` marker below YAML frontmatter in all 12 `agents/*.md`. Claude Code's agent parser requires `---` on line 1; the prior position caused `Agent(subagent_type: "ch-*")` to fail with "not found" while the file stayed marked as managed.
- **README install typo**: `npm install -g /forgen` → `npm install -g @wooojin/forgen` (missing scope).
- **flaky e2e test**: `runHook` helper in `tests/e2e/chain-verification.test.ts` now requires the parsed stdout JSON to carry a `continue` field, preventing stray log lines from satisfying the parser and producing false `continue:false` matches. Verified stable across 3 consecutive full runs (1541/1541 each).

### Documentation

- `docs/weakness-analysis-2026-04-14.md` — Competitor analysis vs 7 harness tools
- `docs/design-skills-agents-plugins.md` — Full design specification with implementation status

- **deep-interview skill**: Deep requirement interview with Ambiguity Score (0-10) quantification across 5 axes (What/Who/How/When/Why)
- **Agent output validation** (Tier 2-F): PostToolUse hook validates sub-agent output for empty/failed/timeout/context overflow
- **BM25 ensemble scoring** (2-C): 3-way ensemble (TF-IDF 0.5 + BM25 0.3 + bigram 0.2) for solution matching
- **Intent-based context injection** (2-B): implement/debug/refactor/review intents inject domain-specific rules
- **Harness maturity diagnosis**: `forgen doctor` shows 5-axis L0-L3 maturity score with Quick Wins
- **Session brief handoff**: Structured brief saved before compact, restored on next session start
- **Output overflow prevention**: Solution injection footer includes head_limit guidance

### Fixed
- **Korean `\b` boundary**: Fixed 7 regex patterns where `\b` failed with Korean text (intent-classifier, keyword-detector)
- **Revert→drift connection**: `isRevert` was always false (checked messages array instead of boolean flag)
- **ALL_MODES missing specify**: `cancelforgen` didn't clear specify state
- **MCP list TypeError**: Crashed on url-format servers without `args` field
- **Agent empty string**: Empty string (`""`) was falsy, skipping validation
- **Solution content regex**: `\Z` is not valid in JavaScript (literal Z), changed to `$`
- **`severity: 'info' as 'warning'`**: Removed forced type assertion

### Changed
- **Rule renderer AI optimization** (2-A): `[category|strength]` tag prefix format, `include_pack_summary` defaults to false (token reduction)
- **Recovery messages** (1-A): ENOENT suggests Glob search, EACCES suggests chmod
- **skill-injector lock**: Session cache protected with `withFileLockSync` (race condition fix)
- **incrementFailureCounter lock**: Context signals protected with `withFileLockSync`
- Docker E2E expanded to 68 checks (Phase 8: Hoyeon analysis verification)

## [5.1.0] - 2026-04-06

- **훅 주입 누락 (W0)**: harness가 hooks.json을 settings.json에 직접 주입 — 플러그인 캐시 없이도 17개 훅 런타임 작동
- **태그 노이즈**: 한국어 조사 strip (`stripKoSuffix`), 영어 스톱워드 6개 추가, MAX_TAGS 10→8

### Added
- `forgen compound retag` CLI 서브커맨드 — 기존 솔루션 태그 일괄 재생성
- `readSolution()` `skipEvidence` 옵션 — compound-search snippet에서 evidence 오염 방지
- `migrateToForgen()` — `~/.compound/` → `~/.forgen/` 자동 마이그레이션 + symlink

### Changed
- 모든 `ME_*` 경로를 `~/.forgen/` 기반으로 통합 (스토리지 이원화 해소)
- `V1_*` 상수 deprecated 처리 (ME_*와 동일 경로)
- 완료/폐기된 계획 21개를 `docs/history/`로 이관

## [5.0.0] - 2026-04-03

### Breaking Changes

- **Personalized orchestration (Phase 2)**: Pipeline Recommender (`forgen pipeline`), Agent Overlay Injection (PreToolUse approve(message)), Contextual Bandit (Factored Beta-TS)
- **Forge auto-init (Phase 0)**: Auto-creates forge-profile via project scan when missing, session endTime backfill, experiment cleanup (`doctor --clean-experiments`)
- **Surprise Detection**: z-score 1.5σ deviation from reward baseline (activates after 30+ observations)
- **Preference Stability**: BKT P(known) stability bars for dimension convergence tracking

### Fixed
- compound-search returned 0 results (tag noise + matchedTags<2 threshold + cross-language gap)
- compound-lifecycle timeout (grep scanned node_modules/dist/.git)
- pattern-detector ignored user-rejection events (only checked user-override)
- 4 HIGH issues from v3 code review (MCP readOnly, gate1 mutation, test homedir, empty assertion)

- **Progressive Disclosure**: Push summaries (~200 tokens), pull full content via MCP (89% token reduction)
- **Hook response utilities**: Shared approve/deny/failOpen functions (Plugin SDK format)
- **Tool-specific matchers**: db-guard→Bash, secret-filter→Write|Edit|Bash, slop-detector→Write|Edit

### Changed

- Dead INJECTION_CAPS (keywordInjectMax, perPromptTotal)

### Fixed
- **compound-lifecycle.ts**: confidence subtraction -20 → -0.20 (was zeroing on 0-1 scale)
- **compound-lifecycle.ts**: Promotion now runs before staleness check (was blocking upgrades)
- **compound-lifecycle.ts**: Identifier staleness aligned to 6+ chars (was 4+, mismatched with Code Reflection)
- **session-recovery.ts**: runExtraction fire-and-forget (3056ms → 151ms)

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **Compound Engine integrity improvements**
  - **Code Reflection false positive prevention** — identifier minimum length raised from 4 to 6 characters, reducing false `reflected++` from common words
  - **"Why" context in auto-extraction** — extracted solutions now include git commit messages, addressing the "git diff only shows what, not why" gap
  - **Staleness detection** — `checkIdentifierStaleness()` verifies solution identifiers still exist in codebase via grep
  - **Extraction precision metrics** — `compound-precision` lab event emitted during lifecycle checks for tracking promotion/retirement rates
- **Token injection guardrail** — `MAX_INJECTED_CHARS_PER_SESSION = 8000` (~2K tokens) caps per-session injection cost, tracked in session cache
- **E2E hook pipeline tests** — 7 integration tests verifying actual hook stdin→stdout JSON protocol (solution-injector, keyword-detector, pre-tool-use, slop-detector, db-guard)
- **fgx security warning** — CLI now emits 3-line warning on startup when permissions are skipped
- **Documentation**
  - Open source readiness review feedback (P0/P1/P2 prioritized)
  - Action plan v2.1 (7 phases, 33 items, 18 success criteria)

  - Auto vs manual extraction tradeoff guide
  - oh-my-claudecode coexistence guide
  - Case study template for dogfooding data
  - Good first issues list (6 issues)

### Fixed
- **3 failing tests** — slop-detector-main.test.ts depended on local `~/.compound/hook-config.json` (now mocked)
- **106 empty catch blocks → 0** — all replaced with `debugLog()` or descriptive comments explaining why safe to ignore
- **70 biome lint warnings → 5** — `noAssignInExpressions`, non-null assertions, array index keys, etc. (remaining: `useTemplate`, `useLiteralKeys`)
- **CI coverage double-run** — merged `npm test` + `--coverage` into single vitest invocation to prevent mock state corruption

### Changed
- **Coverage thresholds** — aligned vitest.config.ts with actual coverage (35% lines) instead of unrealistic 85%. CI now enforces thresholds.
- **Node.js requirement** — 18 → 20 (vitest v4/rolldown requires `node:util.styleText`)
- **CI matrix** — removed Node 18, kept Node 20 + 22
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — replaced "No linter yet" with Biome instructions, added architecture diagram
- **README** — added vendor lock-in notice, "When to Use" table, fgx warning section
- **Multi-language READMEs** — synced KO/ZH/JA with all English changes
- **GitHub Actions** — checkout v4→v6, setup-node v4→v6

### Dependencies

## [1.6.3] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fix ESM import side-effect causing double JSON output in `skill-injector` and `post-tool-use` hooks — root cause of Stop hook errors across environments
- **CRITICAL**: Fix "cancel ralph" activating ralph mode instead of canceling — keyword pattern priority conflict
- **CRITICAL**: Fix path traversal vulnerability via unsanitized `session_id` in file paths (7 hooks affected)
- Fix Stop hook timeout race condition — 0ms margin between plugin timeout and stdin read timeout
- Fix non-atomic file writes causing state corruption under concurrent sessions (9 hooks)
- Fix `readStdinJSON` missing `process.stdin.resume()` causing silent timeout in some Node.js environments
- Fix `readStdinJSON` having no input size limit (potential memory exhaustion)
- Fix user-supplied regex patterns in `dangerous-patterns.json` vulnerable to ReDoS
- Fix `ralph` keyword false positive matching on casual mentions
- Fix `pipeline` keyword requiring "pipeline mode" suffix — standalone "pipeline" now works
