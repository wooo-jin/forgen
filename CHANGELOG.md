## [Unreleased] - 2026-04-16

### Added — Self-Evolving Harness (inspired by Stanford meta-harness)

Three-phase evolution loop around the existing compound solution store:

**Phase 1 — Fitness Loop (Select axis):**
- `solution-outcomes`: per-session inject→outcome event log (accept/correct/error/unknown) with fail-open semantics; attribution through solution-injector (appendPending/flushAccept), correction-record MCP (attributeCorrection), and post-tool-failure hook (attributeError).
- `solution-fitness`: Laplace-smoothed acceptance ratio × log(1+injected) confidence. State classification: draft / active / champion / underperform. No auto-delete — population-relative thresholds only.
- `solution-quarantine`: malformed frontmatter no longer silently dropped — invalid files surface in `~/.forgen/state/solution-quarantine.jsonl` with actionable diagnostics; `listQuarantined` / `pruneQuarantine` helpers.
- `solution-fixup`: schema migration for legacy defects (missing `extractedBy`, missing `evidence` block, missing `supersedes`). Applied to the live install, this recovered 5 dead solutions and one was injected on the next matching prompt.

**Phase 4 — Self-Evolution (Propose + Select axes):**
- `solution-weakness`: structured discovery report from four detectors — under-served tags (correction evidence without a matching champion), conflict clusters, dead corners (injected=0 with unique tags), volatile solutions (accept-rate shift >0.3).
- `ch-solution-evolver` agent: Opus proposer, Bash-disabled, emits exactly 3 novel candidates into `~/.forgen/lab/candidates/` with 30%-80% tag overlap gate and self-critique novelty check.
- Candidate cold-start bonus: solutions with `status: candidate` get confidence × 1.3 so they reach enough injections to accumulate fitness. Auto-promotes to `verified` at 5 injections; bonus disappears naturally.
- Candidate lifecycle: `promoteCandidate` validates schema + refuses name collisions before moving files from lab to `me/solutions`. `rollbackSince` archives every `source: evolved` solution newer than a cutoff to `~/.forgen/lab/archived/rollback-{ts}/` (never deletes — always recoverable).

**CLI surface:**
- `forgen learn fix-up [--apply]` — dry-run repair of malformed solutions.
- `forgen learn quarantine [--prune]` — show / clean dropped solutions.
- `forgen learn fitness [--json]` — per-solution fitness table.
- `forgen learn evolve [--save]` — weakness report + proposer hint.
- `forgen learn evolve --promote --list` / `--promote <name>` — candidate promotion.
- `forgen learn evolve --rollback <epoch-ms-or-ISO>` — time-bounded rollback.
- Dashboard gains a 🎯 Solution Fitness panel (state distribution + top-3).

**Dogfood evidence:** the full pipeline was exercised end-to-end — weakness report → evolver-agent proposal → schema validation → promotion → cold-start-boosted match (relevance 0.78) → injection counter increment.

### Documentation
- `docs/design-solution-evolution.md` — Phase 4 design spec with open questions, prerequisites, and rollout plan.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-15

### BREAKING

- **Skill consolidation: 21 → 10**. Removed: refactor, tdd, testing-strategy, documentation, git-master, ecomode, specify, performance, incident-response, database, frontend, ci-cd, api-design, debug-detective, migrate, security-review. Most were generic checklists; their content is better handled by Claude natively or absorbed into remaining skills.
- **Agent consolidation: 19 → 12**. Removed: performance-reviewer, security-reviewer (merged into code-reviewer as review perspectives), refactoring-expert, code-simplifier (merged into executor), scientist, qa-tester (merged into verifier), writer.
- **Custom frontmatter removed**: Agents no longer use `tier` and `lane` fields (Claude Code ignored them anyway).

### Added

- **5 new skills** designed from best-in-class research (OMC ralph, gstack /ship, /retro, /learn):
  - `forge-loop`: PRD-based iteration with Stop hook persistence. Prevents polite-stop anti-pattern.
  - `ship`: 15-step automated release pipeline with "never ask, just do" philosophy + Review Readiness Dashboard + Verification Gate.
  - `retro`: Weekly retrospective with git analysis + compound health + learning trend + compare mode.
  - `learn`: Compound knowledge management — 5 subcommands (search/stats/prune/export/import) with stale & duplicate detection.
  - `calibrate`: Evidence-based profile adjustment — quantitative protocol, 3-correction threshold, max 2 axes per calibration.
- **Stop hook forge-loop integration** (`context-guard.ts`): When `.forgen/state/forge-loop.json` has incomplete stories, Stop is blocked with persistence message. Circuit breakers: 2h stale threshold, 30 max blocks.
- **Learning Dashboard** (`forgen dashboard`): New "Learning Curve" section showing correction trend (7d vs prev 7d), top correction axes, activity days, estimated time saved via compound injections.
- **Session Summary with Counterfactual**: Session end message now includes "주입된 compound: N건 / 추정 절약 시간: Xh Ym (forgen 없었으면 시행착오 필요)".
- **Plugin system**: `.forgen/skills/*.md` scan path added. Project-level custom skills supported.
- **Stale agent cleanup**: `harness.ts` `installAgents` now removes `ch-*.md` files that don't exist in current source (with marker + hash verification for user-modification safety).

### Changed

- **All 10 skills upgraded** with `<Compound_Integration>`, `<Failure_Modes>`, `argument-hint`. Density dramatically improved despite fewer skills.
- **All 12 agents upgraded** with `<Failure_Modes_To_Avoid>`, `<Examples>` (Good/Bad), `<Success_Criteria>`, and official frontmatter (`maxTurns`, `color`, `permissionMode`).
- **deep-interview rewritten** using OMC research: weighted 4-dimension scoring, 3 challenge modes (Contrarian/Simplifier/Ontologist), ontology stability tracking, anti-sycophancy rules, one-question-at-a-time protocol.
- **Cancel flow**: `cancelforgen` now also deletes `forge-loop.json` to release Stop hook block.
- **Install is global-only**: `package.json` sets `preferGlobal: true` so non-global installs surface a warning (forgen is a CLI on PATH; local installs were unreachable).
- **README**: Added "12 built-in agents" section grouped by tool access (read-only / plan-only / write-enabled) with the absorbed-agent mapping from the 19→12 consolidation.

### Fixed

- **Agent parser compat**: Moved `<!-- forgen-managed -->` marker below YAML frontmatter in all 12 `agents/*.md`. Claude Code's agent parser requires `---` on line 1; the prior position caused `Agent(subagent_type: "ch-*")` to fail with "not found" while the file stayed marked as managed.
- **README install typo**: `npm install -g /forgen` → `npm install -g @wooojin/forgen` (missing scope).
- **flaky e2e test**: `runHook` helper in `tests/e2e/chain-verification.test.ts` now requires the parsed stdout JSON to carry a `continue` field, preventing stray log lines from satisfying the parser and producing false `continue:false` matches. Verified stable across 3 consecutive full runs (1541/1541 each).

- **106 empty catch blocks → 0** — all replaced with `debugLog()` or descriptive comments explaining why safe to ignore
- **70 biome lint warnings → 5** — `noAssignInExpressions`, non-null assertions, array index keys, etc. (remaining: `useTemplate`, `useLiteralKeys`)
- **CI coverage double-run** — merged `npm test` + `--coverage` into single vitest invocation to prevent mock state corruption

### Changed
- **Coverage thresholds** — aligned vitest.config.ts with actual coverage (35% lines) instead of unrealistic 85%. CI now enforces thresholds.
